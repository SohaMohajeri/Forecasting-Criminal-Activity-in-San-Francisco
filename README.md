Crime is one of the dominant aspects of our society but What if you could predict where an illegal act will take place before it occurred, or you could determine the time of the incident or the identity of the culprit in advance? Well Sounds a bit like science fiction But Social scientists have always believed that historical crime trends often influence future patterns, and In the recent time, it is seen that artificial intelligence has made crime prediction feasible.


The ability to predict different types of offenses which can occur in future on the basis of time, location and so forth can help the law enforcement agencies in preventing the crime. In this way, police can better prevent crime in the future or allocate funds in much-needed areas to handle it.

This will also empower general public to better understand the risks they face, and plan their routines accordingly. So users can explore the past incidents and see the historical distribution of crime trends across the city. and they can filter crime types – for example homicide or  assault or robbery – and different times of year., and see the filtered data as a heat map 

They can also see the probable future incidents as an interactive and high-resolution map. and The colour scheme displays risk of felony ranging from lower to higher probabilities, allowing users to check the risks in their actual location or future destination in the particular times of day and days of the week


In this project, multiple open data sources and incident data from the San Frasisco Police Department are used which are available online at data.sfgov.org. Specifically, 6 datasets about the Date, time and category of crime and Neighborhood and geometry of incident and also Age gender and income of residents in each neighborhood are used and heatmaps are created to see which type of offense is more common in each neighborhood And Finally, probabilities of crimes of different categories taking place in a given neighborhood and date are predicted.
